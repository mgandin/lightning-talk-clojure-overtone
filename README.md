# tutorial

Some examples to do a bit of live-coding with Clojure, Overtone and SuperCollider.

## Usage

Install Clojure, Leiningen & Overtone. You can follow the indications on the Overtone website : https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki

Type lein deps in command line, start Emacs Live or Lighttable and make some noises ...

This code was presented at the Paris Java User Group : http://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/bin/view/Meeting/20140114

livecoding.clj is a short presentation of overtone and core.clj is a small composition (it sounds a bit like IDM and John Carpenter ...)
